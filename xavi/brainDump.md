_This is Xavi's sketch file for ideas, issues, readmes... anything that is not fully developed yet_\

# Do we need `origin`?
- We use it as ankor point

# RDF and semantic triplets

# No concensus
- We want to enhance the mind. And its subjective view.
- Our tools don't serve a platform but a mind.
- Concensus is a layer on top of the mind subjective view.

# Bi-directional links

# Relationship dimensions

# Documentation praxis manifesto
- Documentation should be implicit when possible (ex: function with a good descriptive name), otherwise
    - Documention should be derived from the implementation automatically
- Documentation needs to be acessible. Is not ok for a documentation to exists if is hard to reach
- Avoid links that can be broken easly.
- No broken documentation. No todos, no WIP. A documentation entry should be be cohesive with itself. While a section with WIP may be necessary
- Documention should be developed in paralel of an implementation. (Ex: Do not accept a PR without its corresponding documentation)
- KISS: Can you say the same with less words. Can you use easier words?

# Encapsulation
- The smaller the encapsulation, the more reasuable
- Context

# How to create links


### Node
We are working towards eliminating this word from our dictionary because it keeps generating confusion. There are a lot of types of nodes, they almost represent the same thing, but they don't.

### Node cluster [OUTDATED]
One of the [original specs](##-original-specs) was:
> It needs to work on a global domain. This means that two different mindmaps pointing to the same concept should converge if put together

We call this convergence a `node cluster`. In other words is the set of nodes that are pointing to the same `CID`.
