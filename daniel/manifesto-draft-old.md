# understanding what information is

## properties

- now
    - we have access to a massive amount of information (through any device connected to the internet)
- vision
    - more accessible. no censorship

- quantity
    - we have access to a massive amount of information (through any device connected to the internet)
- quality
    - echo chambers
    - misinformation
- size
    - Atomicity
    - encapsulation
    - the paradox of choice: more is less, less is more
- other
    - Accesibility. no censorship
    - Re-usability
    - Resolution
    - Unicity (no de-duplication)
    - Connection, origin

## how we relate to it

**how do we process information?** our relationship with information, a process of understanding, we transform information we collect collectively into new pieces of information

- retrieve information
    - from the collective knowledge base
        - curated lists (filter)
    - from our senses? exposed to
    - from our archive?
- time (energy) for digesting / being exposed one piece of information
    - Brevity in communication is becoming a problem. Efficiency for the individual is not equal to efficiency for the collective
    - fomo
- visualize (percepcio, display) information. different renders (or interfaces) for the same data/information
- organizing information: create your map, your archive/collection
    - digital expansion of our brain
- connecting information > insight?
    - we connect A (new) + B (old) > retrieve information (past experiences) from our personal archive (B)
    - connecting any piece of information regardless of their format or file-system
    - connections are happening all the time?
- create new information, transform connections into experience, make information and its connections usable > create your own knowledge?
    - the data you generate has value. you don't own your data
    - we expand our reality, our understanding of the world
        - in consequence, we modify our identity: identity is a collection of information (private or public)
- store information/insight/knowledge
    - memory vs extended memory using digital systems
- share and distribute information
    - more efficient tools to distribute information, the price is going towards zero. implications?
    - Data ownership?

# context

## goals
- Allow to model the analog reality (make sense of the world)
- Transcend our brain limitations
- We don't need to express context
- We are not limited by concensus (dictionary)

## approach
- finite games vs infinite, and its implications on developing new(s) technology
- access and inclusivity

## general and abstract thoughts

- Everything is energy and energy is information in its purest sense. **The brain receives information and translates into a picture called reality.**
    - by putting pieces of information together we create stories
    - everything we do, think or feel is because of information.
    - inspire in the same way you get inspired by others. inspiration as energy, fuel for personal and collective growth > evolution
- the transformative power of technology
    - Empower people through ideas and tools. There is a huge potential for change for you and for others, when you become an active agent in your own life.
    - we know that change is possible. We have access to the tools and knowledge to use them. We can create our own tools and learn what becomes necessary. 
- state of the art for technology: We are at the Age of Information, which is not the same to say that we are living in the Age of Understanding. Information has no meaning by itself.
    - meaningful connections of information and understanding (in the digital world or using digital technolgies) leads to:
        - human-to-human connections (collective knowledge/experiences)
        - better understanding of ourselves
- other topics to explore
    - Mental ontology
    - Why Wikipedia, the dictionary or the blockchain are "horrible things"
    - Information is native to he digital subjective domain
        - You can only fact check what is native of this domain
        - It takes over other domains
