### Tools

Marshall McLuhan famously said **"We shape our tools. And then our tools shape us."** McLuhan was referring to the fact that our social practices co-evolve with our use of new tools and the refinements we make to existing tools. [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool)

**"You want your tools to be used in ways that you didn't anticipate."** Joi Ito [7:27](https://youtu.be/gm6YeeYOJ38?t=447)

### How

"So I think the good news is that even though the world is extremely complex, what you need to do is very simple. I think it's about stopping this notion that you need to plan everything, you need to stock everything, and you need to be so prepared, and focus on being connected, always learning, fully aware, and super present." Joi Ito, [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/joi_ito_want_to_innovate_become_a_now_ist/) (11:33)
