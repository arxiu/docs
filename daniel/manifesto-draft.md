- Everything is energy and energy is information in its purest sense.
    - by putting pieces of information together we create stories
    - everything we do, think or feel is because of information.
    - inspire in the same way you get inspired by others. inspiration as energy, fuel for personal and collective growth > evolution
- the transformative power of technology
    - Empower people through ideas and tools. There is a huge potential for change for you and for others, when you become an active agent in your own life.
    - we know that change is possible. We have access to the tools and knowledge to use them. We can create our own tools and learn what becomes necessary. 
- state of the art for technology: We are at the Age of Information, which is not the same to say that we are living in the Age of Understanding. Information has no meaning by itself.
    - meaningful connections of information and understanding (in the digital world or using digital technolgies) leads to:
        - human-to-human connections (collective knowledge/experiences)
        - better understanding of ourselves
- understanding properties of information. anatomy
    - quantity
        - we have access to a massive amount of information (through any device connected to the internet)
    - quality
        - echo chambers
        - misinformation
    - size
        - encapsulation
        - the paradox of choice: more is less, less is more
- how do we process information? our relationship with information, a process of understanding, we transform information we collect collectively into new pieces of information
    - retrieve information
        - from the collective knowledge base
            - curated lists (filter)
        - from our senses? exposed to
        - from our archive?
    - time (energy) for digesting / being exposed one piece of information
        - Brevity in communication is becoming a problem. Efficiency for the individual is not equal to efficiency for the collective
        - fomo
    - visualize (percepcio, display) information. different renders (or interfaces) for the same data/information
    - organizing information: create your map, your archive/collection
        - digital expansion or our brain
    - connecting information > insight?
        - we connect A (new) + B (old) > retrieve information (past experiences) from our personal archive (B)
        - connecting any piece of information regardless of their format or file-system
        - connections are happening all the time?
    - create new information, transform connections into experience, make information and its connections usable > create your own knowledge?
        - the data you generate has value. you don't own your data
        - we expand our reality, our understanding of the world
            - in consequence, we modify our identity: identity is a collection of information (private or public)
    - store information/insight/knowledge
        - memory vs extended memory using digital systems
    - share and distribute information
        - more efficient tools to distribute information, the price is going towards zero. implications?
- approach
    - finite games vs infinite, and its implications on developing new(s) technology
    - access and inclusivity
