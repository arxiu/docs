what system makes more sense? is more natural? is more aligned to life in general and to our brain in particular?

[Difference between a distributed and a decentralized network](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49195562/difference-between-a-distributed-and-a-decentralized-network)

A distributed system is a network that consists of autonomous computers that are connected using a distribution middleware. **They help in sharing different resources and capabilities to provide users with a single and integrated coherent network**. ([Distributed System](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/18909/distributed-system))

"A decentralized system is one which requires multiple parties to make their own independent decisions" In such a decentralized system, there is no single centralized authority that makes decisions on behalf of all the parties. Instead each party, also called a peer, makes local autonomous decisions towards its individual goals which may possibly conflict with those of other peers. Peers directly interact with each other and share information or provide service to other peers. ([Decentralization](https://isr.uci.edu/projects/pace/decentralization.html))

[What is the difference between decentralized and distributed systems?](https://medium.com/distributed-economy/what-is-the-difference-between-decentralized-and-distributed-systems-f4190a5c6462)

A decentralized system is a subset of a distributed system.

Decentralized means that there is no single point where the decision is made. Every node makes a decision for it’s own behaviour and the resulting system behaviour is the aggregate response.

[What’s the difference between Decentralized and Distributed ?](https://medium.com/nakamo-to/whats-the-difference-between-decentralized-and-distributed-1b8de5e7f5a4)

Centralization and decentralization refer to levels of control.

> In a centralized system, control is exerted by just one entity (a person or an enterprise, for example). In a decentralized system, there is no single controlling entity. Instead, control is shared among several independent entities.

Distribution refers to differences of location.

> In a non-distributed (or co-located) system, all the parts of the system are in the same physical location. In a distributed system, parts of the system exist in separate locations.

1. CENTRALIZED SYSTEMS:
    - Example – Wikipedia.
    - Characteristics of Centralized System
        - Presence of a global clock:
    - Advantages of Centralized System
        - Easy to physically secure.
        - Smooth and elegant personal experience
    - Disadvantages of Centralized System
        - Highly dependent on the network connectivity – System can fail if the nodes lose connectivity as there is only one central node.
        - No graceful degradation of system – abrupt failure of the entire system
        - Less possibility of data backup. If the server node fails and there is no backup, you lose the data straight away
2. DECENTRALIZED SYSTEMS:
    - In decentralized systems, every node makes its own decision. The final behavior of the system is the aggregate of the decisions of the individual nodes. 
    - Characteristics of Decentralized System
        - Lack of a global clock:
    - Architecture of Decentralized System
        - peer-to-peer architecture – all nodes are peers of each other. No one node has supremacy over other nodes
        - master-slave architecture – One node can become a master by voting and help in coordinating of a part of the system but this does not mean the node has supremacy over the other node which it is coordinating
    - Limitations of Decentralized System
        - May lead to problem of coordination at the enterprise level – When every node is owner of its own behavior, its difficult to achieve collective tasks
    - Advantages of Decentralized System
        - High availability – Some nodes(computers, mobiles, servers) are always available/online for work, leading to high availability
        - More autonomy and control over resources – As each node controls its own behavior, it has better autonomy leading to more control over resources
    - Disadvantages of Decentralized System
        - Difficult to achieve global big tasks – No chain of command to command others to perform certain tasks
3. DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS:
    - Characteristics of Distributed System
        - Concurrency of components: Nodes apply consensus protocols to agree on same values/transactions/commands/logs.
        - Lack of a global clock:
        - Independent failure of components: In a distributed system, nodes fail independently without having a significant effect on the entire system. If one node fails, the entire system sans the failed node continue to work.
    - Limitations of Distributed System
        - Difficult for a node to get the global view of the system and hence take informed decisions based on the state of other nodes in the system
    - Advantages of Distributed System
        - Low latency than centralized system – Distributed systems have low latency because of high geographical spread, hence leading to less time to get a response
    - Disadvantages of Distributed System
        - Difficult to achieve consensus
