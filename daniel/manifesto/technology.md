- the transformative power of technology
    - Empower people through ideas and tools. There is a huge potential for change for you and for others, when you become an active agent in your own life.
    - we know that change is possible. We have access to the tools and knowledge to use them. We can create our own tools and learn what becomes necessary. 
  

what I am pointing out is to our attitude towards life, to our small and big actions against the default mode, against the status quo.

change implies movement, action, experience, tangible or intangible, and only by moving ourselves and embracing change we can grow, mature and evolve.

this speech is not new. the internet is full, just search for it: "change your behavior", "break a bad habit", "positive thinking", "motivational quotes" and so on. 

I think the message is clear, **we know that change is possible**.

and the same internet provided with lots of proposals and strategies to achieve it. too many of them. an overwhelming amount of them. 


the same way we feel we can confirm ideas easily (confirmation bias?)
we can get stuck on finding THE response


every technology carries hope as well as despair with it. but not 

the internet and its hyperconnectivity has a collosal potential for the good and for the bad.

we have now access to extraordinary tools and knowledge to use them, but more importantly, access to knowledge to learn how to create our own tools.
