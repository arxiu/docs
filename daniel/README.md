## Hello

My name is Daniel and I am deeply interested in human behaviour.

Some time ago, I worked as an interaction designer, creating physical [interactive](http://armengol-altayo.com/#invaders) [installations](http://armengol-altayo.com/#simon) that gathered people in a specific time and place to experiment new ways to relate each other. My goal was to generate meaningful connections between people <sup id="back1">[[1]](#footnote1)</sup>.

In the last years, I gradually moved from design to artistic practice. Concepts like hacking <sup id="back2">[[2]](#footnote2)</sup> or prototyping appeared and permeated naturally in my persona.

[I built robots](https://vimeo.com/234877889) to show us how easy it is that [we automate our own gestures](http://armengol-altayo.com/#artificialselfie) without realizing it, and [I even performed as a robot for a while](http://armengol-altayo.com/#follow), to experiment with the power of digital devices as behavioural design tools.

My profile has been always difficult to categorize. I feel comfortable working in the  intangible realm of concepts and ideas, and I don't consider myself an expert in any particular field <sup id="back3">[[3]](#footnote3)</sup>. Instead of focusing only on one specific topic, I collected experiences and developed knowledge in different areas, giving me in return a wider perspective to draw connections and recognize patterns that experts may have more difficulties to see.

## Why am I here?

Here a list with some of my personal **motivations and reasons** that make me to be involved in this project.

- I would like to see this beautiful hyperconnected world, better connected, not for some, but for all. If we can start giving real meaning to all this connections, maybe we can understand each other better, reduce conflict and increase cooperation. Maybe then, we can also understand ourselves better.

- Inspire people, the same way I feel constantly inspired by others. I believe in the power of inspiration as fuel for personal growth.

- Empower people through ideas and tools. There is a huge potential for change for you and for others, when you become an active agent in your own life.

- I know that change is possible. We have access to the tools and knowledge to use them. We can create our own tools and learn what becomes necessary. There is no better time than now.

*A couple of days before start writting this, I was listening a conversation within Sam Harris and Yuval Noah Harari, and at the end during the Q&A, Yuval gave two advices. Know yourself better, and join an organization <sup id="back4">[[4]](#footnote4)</sup>. I think that without knowing it, I am in the path of following both. After a few years of conscious efforts on knowing myself better, I think I am ready to put time and energy to join an organization, or at least this is my way to understand what I am doing with Xavi here.*

###### Footnotes

<a id="footnote1">[1]</a> I used my [business cards](http://armengol-altayo.com/bc) to ilustrate what I do. In fact, they are not *my* business cards, they are all from other people, but with my contact sticked on it. When I meet a person, we chat a little, and sometimes, it arises the situation where it makes sense to exchange contact details. I give my email then, but together with the contact details of another person that I believe could be of interest for the person I have right in front of me.

Ok, let's give an example. Imagine that maybe she is a photographer very active in Instagram, planning to move all her work to a personal website in order to have more control about how to display her work. Don't you think that would be a natural thing to introduce her to the web developer I casually met in an event the other day, who was tired to work on tasteless projects for boring companies? Or maybe connect her to another photographer I met two months ago, who has an amazing web page but doesn't have an Instagram account yet? <sup>[back](#back1)</sup>

<a id="footnote3">[3]</a> I like the concept of [*antidisciplinary*](https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2014/10/02/antidisciplinar.html) explained by Joi Ito. <sup>[back](#back3)</sup>

<a id="footnote4">[4]</a> "To get to **know yourself better**, because we are now in the era in which we are hackable animals. [...] Second advice I can give, **join an organization**. If you want to make a real difference in the world it's almost impossible to do it as an individual activist."
