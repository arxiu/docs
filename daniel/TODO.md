- relationship between technology and people  
- relationship between technology and power  
- understanding information as a technology, is then information a soft power?  
- individualist society (links to check: [1](https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2012-spring/individualism-collectivism/), [2](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-individualistic-cultures-2795273), [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualistic_culture))

- information theory
- meme
- The physicist John Archibald Wheeler coined an epigram to encapsulate the concept behind information theory: "**It from bit**." It described the idea that the smallest particle of every piece of matter is a binary question, a 1 or a 0. From these pieces of information, other things could develop — like DNA, matter and living organisms.

#### Render / Visualization
- "Jacques Bertin (1918- ) published Semiologie Graphique (1963), which became the essential book for organizing visual and perceptual elements in accordance with information characteristics and relations." **The History of Schematics in Data Visualization**. *Sheila Pontis, October 2007*. 

    1. Graphic representation has a double function for Bertin: as an artificial memory and as a tool for discovery, bound to the huge power of visual perception. [source](https://web.archive.org/web/20050113053951/http://www.infovis.net/printMag.php?num=84&lang=2)
