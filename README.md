# InterPlanetary Mind Map
*In this repository we are going to collect all documents, random ideas and thoughts related with the project itself. Everything you can find here is considered work-in-progress, and yes, probably most will not make sense yet, but it’s ok. Ask directly about the specifics you want to know more. We invite you to participate. Any comment, suggestion or commit will be very much appreciated. Thank you in advance. :-)*
